## Informational Website for ICT Students - University of Turin

This project is a static, multi-page informational website designed for prospective and current students of the "Innovazione sociale, Comunicazione e nuove Tecnologie" (ICT) degree course at the University of Turin.

As an unofficial student-led initiative, this site was created by Matteo Ninotti and Carlo Pagliaro to consolidate essential information about the course, campus life, and student opportunities into a single, easy-to-navigate resource.

### About The Project

The primary goal of this website is to offer a clear and comprehensive overview of everything related to the ICT course. It covers a wide range of topics, from the academic curriculum and career opportunities to practical details about the campus and student services. The design is clean, user-friendly, and fully responsive.

### Key Features

#### Comprehensive Content Structure: The site is logically organized into sections covering all major aspects of student life:

        Home (index.html): An introduction to the ICT course and its core concepts.

        The Course (ilCorso.html): Details on the educational offerings and objectives.

        The Einaudi Campus (ilCampusEinaudi.html): Information about the campus location, including maps and a description of the facilities.

        News and Announcements (newsAvvisi.html): A section for events and updates relevant to students.

        The ICT Student (loStudenteIct.html): An "ideal student" profile and a link to a student-run questionnaire.

        Where to Eat (doveMangiare.html): Practical information about the university cafeteria, including opening hours presented in a structured table.

        Useful Info (infoUtili.html): Guidance on postgraduate studies, professional opportunities, and how university credits (CFU) work.

        Responsive Design: The website features a fluid layout that adapts to different screen sizes. The CSS includes media queries to ensure a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices, most notably re-stacking the footer columns on smaller screens.

        Accessibility & Semantic HTML: The project uses semantic HTML5 tags (<header>, <nav>, <footer>, <article>, <section>) to improve structure and accessibility, as proven by the Accessibility Checker validation attached.

        accesskey attributes are also used throughout the site to facilitate keyboard navigation.

#### Modern CSS Styling:

A sticky navigation bar provides persistent, easy access to all pages.

Custom web fonts (Quicksand, Montserrat, Bowlby One) from Google Fonts are used to create a distinct visual identity.

Interactive hover effects on navigation links enhance the user experience.

No Dependencies: The project is built with pure HTML and CSS, requiring no JavaScript, libraries, or frameworks, making it lightweight and easy to maintain.
